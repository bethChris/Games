## Cake Stack

### Conceptual Overview

A player is anchored to the bottom of the screen with a plate above 
their head. Objects are coming down from the top of the screen. The goal 
is to collect items to create a cake. Collecting not cakable items 
causes you to lose a life. 

### Technical Implementation
I want this to be a web app.

- javascript, html, css (maybe react?)
